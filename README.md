## Basic Build Instructions

1. open Ubuntu Bash and clone the project repository
2. on the command line execute ./install-ubuntu.sh
3. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
4. Compile: `cmake .. && make` 
5. Launch the simulator from Windows and execute the run command for the project ./ExtendedKF (Make sure you also run the simulator on the Windows host machine) If you see this message, it is working Listening to port 4567 Connected!!! 
   You can find some sample inputs in 'data/'.

## Generating Additional Data

This is optional!

If you'd like to generate your own radar and lidar data, see the
[utilities repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Mercedes-SF-Utilities) for
Matlab scripts that can generate additional data.
